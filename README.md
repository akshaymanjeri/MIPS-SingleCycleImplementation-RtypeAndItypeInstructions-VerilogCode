# MIPS-SingleCycleImplementation-RtypeAndItypeInstructions-VerilogCode
The Verilog code to implement a 4-bit MIPS Single Cycle Processor where the instructions are given in a 12-bit binary format. The Code, Datapath Diagram and Dataflow Diagram is provided.
The processor works with 4 registers which are 4-bit each. The registers are implmented using D-FlipFlops.
